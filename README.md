# Train-Display

Create a UI using Bootstrap,

Have Forms assigned to variables to save user input

Store variables as Objects inside Firebase DB

Run Moment JS Methods on the variables holding the train frquency, and train first time

On refresh, updated Values and Trains should still be there due to the Data Base holding onto those values and appending them to new Table Rows
